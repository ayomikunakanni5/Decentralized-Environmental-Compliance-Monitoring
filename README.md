# Decentralized Environmental Compliance Monitoring System

## Overview

The Decentralized Environmental Compliance Monitoring System is a blockchain-based platform that revolutionizes how industrial facilities monitor, verify, and report environmental compliance. By leveraging distributed ledger technology, IoT integration, and smart contracts, this system creates an immutable, transparent record of environmental data that benefits industrial operators, regulatory agencies, and the public while ensuring regulatory requirements are met with integrity and efficiency.

## Core Components

### 1. Facility Verification Contract

This smart contract establishes and maintains the digital identity of industrial facilities within the compliance network.

- Validates and registers industrial facilities using multi-factor authentication
- Maintains essential facility information including location, industry sector, and operational status
- Verifies facility ownership and authorized representatives
- Manages facility certification and accreditation status
- Implements role-based access controls for facility data
- Records facility inspection history and compliance status
- Provides secure, verifiable facility credentials for system interactions
- Links facilities to parent companies and regulatory jurisdictions

### 2. Permit Management Contract

This contract digitizes and manages environmental permits and their associated compliance requirements.

- Creates digital representations of environmental permits and authorizations
- Records permitted emission limits and operational parameters
- Tracks permit validity periods and renewal requirements
- Maintains historical permit modifications and amendments
- Implements regulatory compliance rule sets based on jurisdiction
- Manages variance requests and special authorization periods
- Provides transparency into permitted activities and limitations
- Automates permit renewal notifications and compliance deadlines
- Enables regulatory updates to be propagated across the network

### 3. Sensor Data Contract

This contract securely captures, validates, and stores environmental monitoring data from facility sensors.

- Registers and authenticates monitoring devices and data sources
- Captures real-time emissions and environmental quality data
- Implements data validation protocols to ensure integrity
- Creates tamper-proof records of all environmental measurements
- Manages calibration records and measurement accuracy metadata
- Processes continuous and periodic monitoring data streams

- Enables data aggregation for compliance period reporting
- Implements data retention policies based on regulatory requirements
- Provides cryptographic proof of data provenance

### 4. Violation Detection Contract

This contract automatically analyzes monitoring data against permit requirements to identify potential compliance issues.

- Continuously compares real-time data against permitted thresholds
- Implements complex compliance algorithms for various regulatory frameworks
- Detects exceedances, deviations, and potential violations
- Calculates severity and duration of non-compliance events
- Generates automated alerts for detected violations
- Implements escalation protocols based on violation severity
- Records violation details with supporting evidence
- Manages violation lifecycle from detection to resolution
- Supports root cause analysis and corrective action tracking
- Provides historical compliance performance analytics

### 5. Reporting Contract

This contract generates verified compliance reports for regulatory submissions and public disclosure.

- Creates authenticated compliance reports for regulatory authorities
- Compiles environmental data into standardized reporting formats
- Implements jurisdiction-specific reporting requirements
- Generates public-facing environmental performance disclosures
- Manages reporting schedules and submission deadlines
- Maintains audit trails of report submissions and revisions
- Supports electronic signature and certification processes
- Enables regulatory feedback and response documentation
- Implements transparent public disclosure mechanisms
- Provides APIs for integration with government reporting systems

- IoT sensor integration capabilities

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/environmental-compliance-blockchain.git
   cd environmental-compliance-blockchain
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile the smart contracts:
   ```
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

4. Deploy to a test network:

   ```

## Usage

### Facility Registration

For industrial facilities to join the compliance monitoring network:

```javascript
// Example code for facility registration
const facilityVerification = await FacilityVerification.deployed();
await facilityVerification.registerFacility(
  facilityName,
  facilityLocation,
  industryType,
  regulatoryJurisdictions,
  facilityCertifications,
  { from: ownerAccount }
);
```

### Permit Registration

Adding environmental permits to the blockchain:

```javascript
// Example code to register an environmental permit
const permitManagement = await PermitManagement.deployed();
await permitManagement.registerPermit(
  facilityId,
  permitType,
  permitIdentifier,
  issuingAuthority,
  effectiveDate,
  expirationDate,
  permitDocumentHash,
  { from: authorizedAccount }
);
```

### Registering Emission Limits

Adding specific permitted emission limits to a facility's permit:

```javascript
// Example code for registering emission limits
const permitManagement = await PermitManagement.deployed();
await permitManagement.addEmissionLimit(
  permitId,
  pollutantType,
  limitValue,
  unitOfMeasure,
  averagingPeriod,
  applicableOperatingScenario,
  { from: regulatorAccount }
);
```

### Registering Monitoring Sensors

Adding an emissions monitoring device to the system:

```javascript
// Example code for registering sensors
const sensorData = await SensorData.deployed();
await sensorData.registerSensor(
  facilityId,
  sensorType,
  location,
  pollutantsMeasured,
  certificationDetails,
  calibrationDate,
  { from: facilityOperatorAccount }
);
```

### Reporting Monitoring Data

Submitting environmental monitoring data to the blockchain:

```javascript
// Example code for submitting monitoring data
const sensorData = await SensorData.deployed();
await sensorData.submitMonitoringData(
  sensorId,
  timestamp,
  measurements,
  operatingParameters,
  dataQualityIndicators,
  { from: authorizedSensorAccount }
);
```

### Generating Compliance Reports

Creating official compliance reports for submission to regulators:

```javascript
// Example code for generating compliance reports
const reporting = await Reporting.deployed();
await reporting.generateComplianceReport(
  facilityId,
  reportingPeriodStart,
  reportingPeriodEnd,
  reportType,
  certifyingOfficialId,
  { from: complianceOfficerAccount }
);
```
